    "GoodReads bases all of it Recommendations off of User Reviews and Ratings based on a 5 star scale. Any user can find a recommendation, but must first find and rate 20 books that they have read. This provides a generic item-based collaborative filtering. However, as soon as you start adding to your shelf, the Recommendations increase and become tailored to your specific \"reads\". Much like Pandora, this allows users the ability to enhance their recommendations passed the item-based filtering, and allow a more content filtering, by creating diverse \"Shelves.\" From what I can tell, this site probably links in alot of the books contents (ie. keywords, genres,descriptors) to create a comprehensive selection tailored to a users \"shelve\"  "

As of now, the only classification that have for users are the rating system, and organizing your \"shelves.\" All of it is user input oriented and can be tedious for the casual users. Making the shelves more generic, would incentivies the user, but at the cost of specificity.  "
